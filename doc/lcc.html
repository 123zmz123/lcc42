<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<I>lcc</I>

is an ANSI C compiler for a variety of platforms.
<P>

Arguments whose names end with `.c' (plus `.C' under Windows) are taken to be
C source programs; they are preprocessed, compiled, and
each object program is left on the file
whose name is that of the source with `.o' (UNIX) or `.obj' (Windows)
substituted for the extension.
Arguments whose names end with `.i' are treated similarly,
except they are not preprocessed.
In the same way,
arguments ending with `.s' (plus `.S', `.asm', and `.ASM', under Windows)
are taken to be assembly source programs
and are assembled, producing an object file.
If there are no arguments,
<I>lcc</I>

summarizes its options on the standard error.
<P>

<I>lcc</I>

deletes an object file if and only if exactly one
source file is mentioned and no other file
(source, object, library) or
<B>-l</B>

option is mentioned.
<P>

If the environment variable
<B>LCCINPUTS</B>

is set,
<I>lcc</I>

assumes it gives a semicolon- or colon-separated list of directories in which to
look for source and object files whose names do not begin with `/'.
These directories are also added to the list of directories
searched for libraries.
If
<B>LCCINPUTS</B>

is defined, it must contain `.' in order for the current directory
to be searched for input files.
<P>

<I>lcc</I>

uses ANSI standard header files (see `FILES' below).
Include files not found in the ANSI header files
are taken from the normal default include areas,
which usually includes
<B>/usr/include</B>.

Under Windows, if the environment variable
<B>include</B>

is defined, it gives a semicolon-separated list of directories in which to search for
header files.
<P>

<I>lcc</I>

interprets the following options; unrecognized options are
taken as loader options (see
<I><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ld">ld</A></I>(1))

unless
<B>-c</B>,

<B>-S</B>,

or
<B>-E</B>

precedes them.
Except for
<B>-l</B>,

all options are processed before any of the files
and apply to all of the files.
Applicable options are passed to each compilation phase in the order given.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Suppress the loading phase of the compilation, and force
an object file to be produced even if only one program is compiled.
<DT><B>-g</B>

<DD>
Produce additional symbol table information for the local debuggers.
<I>lcc</I>

warns when
<B>-g</B>

is unsupported.
<DT><B>-Wf-g</B><I>n</I><B>,</B><I>x</I>

<DD>
Set the debugging level to
<I>n</I>

and emit source code as comments into the generated assembly code;
<I>x</I>

must be the assembly language comment character.
If
<I>n</I>

is omitted, it defaults to 1, which is similar to
<B>-g</B>.

Omitting
<B>,</B><I>x</I>

just sets the debugging level to
<I>n</I>.

<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
Suppress warning diagnostics, such as those
announcing unreferenced statics, locals, and parameters.
The line
<I>#pragma ref id</I>

simulates a reference to the variable 
<I>id</I>.

<DT><B>-d</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Generate jump tables for switches whose density is at least
<I>n</I>,

a floating point constant between zero and one.
The default is 0.5.
<DT><B>-A</B>

<DD>
Warns about
declarations and casts of function types without prototypes,
assignments between pointers to ints and pointers to enums, and
conversions from pointers to smaller integral types.
A second
<B>-A</B>

warns about
unrecognized control lines,
nonANSI language extensions and source characters in literals,
unreferenced variables and static functions,
declaring arrays of incomplete types,
and exceeding
<I>some</I>

ANSI environmental limits, like more than 257 cases in switches.
It also arranges for duplicate global definitions in separately compiled
files to cause loader errors.
<DT><B>-P</B>

<DD>
Writes declarations for all defined globals on standard error.
Function declarations include prototypes;
editing this output can simplify conversion to ANSI C.
This output may not correspond to the input when
there are several typedefs for the same type.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
Arrange for the compiler to produce code
that tests for dereferencing zero pointers.
The code reports the offending file and line number and calls
<I><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+abort">abort</A></I>(3).

<DT><B>-O</B>

<DD>
is ignored.
<DT><B>-S</B>

<DD>
Compile the named C programs, and leave the
assembler-language output on corresponding files suffixed `.s' or `.asm'.
<DT><B>-E</B>

<DD>
Run only the preprocessor on the named C programs
and unsuffixed file arguments,
and send the result to the standard output.
<DT><B>-o</B><I>  output</I>

<DD>
Name the output file
<I>output</I>.

If
<B>-c</B>

or
<B>-S</B>

is specified and there is exactly one source file,
this option names the object or assembly file, respectively.
Otherwise, this option names the final executable
file generated by the loader, and `a.out' (UNIX) or `a.exe' (Windows) is left undisturbed.
<I>lcc</I>

warns if
<B>-o</B>

and
<B>-c</B>

or
<B>-S</B>

are given with more than one source file and ignores the
<B>-o</B>

option.
<DT><B>-D</B><I>name=def</I>

<DD>
Define the
<I>name</I>

to the preprocessor, as if by `#define'.
If
<I>=def</I>

is omitted, the name is defined as &quot;1&quot;.
<DT><B>-U</B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Remove any initial definition of
<I>name</I>.

<DT><B>-I</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
`#include' files
whose names do not begin with `/' are always
sought first in the directory of the
<I>file</I>

arguments, then in directories named in
<B>-I</B>

options, then in directories on a standard list.
<DT><B>-N</B>

<DD>
Do not search
<I>any</I>

of the standard directories for `#include' files.
Only those directories specified by subsequent explicit
<B>-I</B>

options will be searched, in the order given.
<DT><B>-B</B><I>str</I>

<DD>
Use the compiler
<B></B><I>str</I><B>rcc</B>

instead of the default version.
Note that
<I>str</I>

often requires a trailing slash.
On Sparcs only,
<B>-Bstatic</B>

and
<B>-Bdynamic</B>

are passed to the loader; see
<I><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+ld">ld</A></I>(1).

<DT><B>-Wo-lccdir=</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Find the preprocessor, compiler proper, and include directory
in the directory
<I>dir/</I>

or
<I>dir\.</I>

If the environment variable
<B>LCCDIR</B>

is defined, it gives this directory.
<I>lcc</I>

warns when this option is unsupported.
<DT><B>-Wf-unsigned_char=1</B>

<DD>
<BR>


<DT><B>-Wf-unsigned_char=0 </B>

<DD>
makes plain
<B>char</B>

an unsigned (1) or signed (0) type; by default,
<B>char</B>

is signed.
<DT><B>-Wf-wchar_t=unsigned_char</B>

<DD>
<BR>


<DT><B>-Wf-wchar_t=unsigned_short</B>

<DD>
<BR>


<DT><B>-Wf-wchar_t=unsigned_int</B>

<DD>
Makes wide characters the type indicated; by default,
wide characters are unsigned short ints, and
<B>wchar_t</B>

is a typedef for unsigned short defined in stddef.h.
The definition for
<B>wchar_t</B>

in stddef.h must correspond to the type specified.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Print commands as they are executed; some of the executed
programs are directed to print their version numbers.
More than one occurrence of
<B>-v</B>

causes the commands to be printed, but
<I>not</I>

executed.
<DT><B>-help</B> or <B>-?</B>

<DD>
Print a message on the standard error summarizing
<I>lcc</I>'s

options and giving the values of the environment variables
<B>LCCINPUTS</B>

and
<B>LCCDIR</B>,

if they are defined.
Under Windows, the values of
<B>include</B>

and
<B>lib</B>

are also given, if they are defined.
<DT><B>-b</B>

<DD>
Produce code that counts the number of times each expression is executed.
If loading takes place, arrange for a
<B>prof.out</B>

file to be written when the object program terminates.
A listing annotated with execution counts can then be generated with
<I><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+bprint">bprint</A></I>(1).

<I>lcc</I>

warns when
<B>-b</B>

is unsupported.
<B>-Wf-C</B>

is similar, but counts only the number of function calls.
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Produce code that counts the number of times each function is called.
If loading takes place, replace the standard startup
function by one that automatically calls
<I><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?3+monitor">monitor</A></I>(3)

at the start and arranges to write a
<B>mon.out</B>

file when the object program terminates normally.
An execution profile can then be generated with
<I><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+prof">prof</A></I>(1).

<I>lcc</I>

warns when
<B>-p</B>

is unsupported.
<DT><B>-pg</B>

<DD>
Causes the compiler to produce counting code like
<B>-p</B>,

but invokes a run-time recording mechanism that keeps more
extensive statistics and produces a 
<B>gmon.out</B>

file at normal termination.
Also, a profiling library is searched, in lieu of the standard C library.
An execution profile can then be generated with
<I><A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+gprof">gprof</A></I>(1).

<I>lcc</I>

warns when
<B>-pg</B>

is unsupported.
<DT><B>-t</B><I>name</I>

<DD>
<BR>


<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Produce code to print the name of the function, an activation number,
and the name and value of each argument at function entry.
At function exit, produce code to print
the name of the function, the activation number, and the return value.
By default,
<I>printf</I>

does the printing; if
<I>name</I>

appears, it does.
For null
<I>char*</I>

values, &quot;(null)&quot; is printed. 
<B>-target</B>

<I>name</I>

is accepted, but ignored.
<DT><B>-tempdir=</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Store temporary files in the directory
<I>dir/</I>

or
<I>dir\.</I>

The default is usually
<B>/tmp</B>.

<DT><B>-W</B><I>xarg</I>

<DD>
pass argument
<I>arg</I>

to the program indicated by
<I>x</I>;

<I>x</I>

can be one of
<B>p</B>,

<B>f</B>,

<B>a</B>,

or
<B>l</B>,

which refer, respectively, to the preprocessor, the compiler proper,
the assembler, and the loader.
<I>arg</I>

is passed as given; if a
<B>-</B>

is expected, it must be given explicitly.
<B>-Wo</B><I>arg</I>

specifies a system-specific option,
<I>arg</I>.

</DL>
<P>

Other arguments
are taken to be either loader option arguments, or C-compatible
object programs, typically produced by an earlier
<I>lcc</I>

run, or perhaps libraries of C-compatible routines.
Duplicate object files are ignored.
These programs, together with the results of any
compilations specified, are loaded (in the order
given) to produce an executable program with name
<B>a.out</B>

(UNIX) or
<B>a.exe</B>

(Windows).
<P>

<I>lcc</I>

assigns the most frequently referenced scalar parameters and
locals to registers whenever possible.
For each block,
explicit register declarations are obeyed first;
remaining registers are assigned to automatic locals if they
are `referenced' at least 3 times.
Each top-level occurrence of an identifier
counts as 1 reference. Occurrences in a loop,
either of the then/else arms of an if statement, or a case
in a switch statement each count, respectively, as 10, 1/2, or 1/10 references.
These values are adjusted accordingly for nested control structures.
<B>-Wf-a</B>

causes
<I>lcc</I>

to read a
<B>prof.out</B>

file from a previous execution and to use the data therein
to compute reference counts (see
<B>-b</B>).

<P>

<I>lcc</I>

is a cross compiler;
<B>-Wf-target=</B><I>target/os</I>

causes
<I>lcc</I>

to generate code for
<I>target</I>

running the operating system denoted by
<I>os</I>.

The supported
<I>target/os</I>

combinations may include
<P>

<H2>LIMITATIONS</H2>



<P>

<I>lcc</I>

accepts the C programming language
as described in the ANSI standard.
If
<I>lcc</I>

is used with the GNU C preprocessor, the
<B>-Wp-trigraphs</B>

option is required to enable trigraph sequences.
<P>

Plain int bit fields are signed.
Bit fields are aligned like unsigned integers but are otherwise laid out
as by most standard C compilers.
Some compilers, such as the GNU C compiler,
may choose other, incompatible layouts.
<P>

Likewise, calling conventions are intended to be compatible with
the host C compiler,
except possibly for passing and returning structures.
Specifically,
<I>lcc</I>

passes and returns structures like host ANSI C compilers
on most targets, but some older host C compilers use different conventions.
Consequently, calls to/from such functions compiled with
older C compilers may not work.
Calling a function that returns
a structure without declaring it as such violates
the ANSI standard and may cause a fault.

The file names listed below are

includes detailed instructions for reporting bugs.
<P>

The ANSI standard headers conform to the specifications in
the Standard, which may be too restrictive for some applications,
but necessary for portability.
Functions given in the ANSI headers may be missing from
some local C libraries (e.g., wide-character functions)
or may not correspond exactly to the local versions;
for example, the ANSI standard
stdio.h
specifies that
<I>printf</I>,

<I>fprintf</I>,

and
<I>sprintf</I>

return the number of characters written to the file or array,
but some existing libraries don't implement this convention.
<P>

On the MIPS and SPARC, old-style variadic functions must use
varargs.h
from MIPS or Sun. New-style is recommended.
<P>

With
<B>-b</B>,

files compiled
<I>without</I>

<B>-b</B>

may cause
<I>bprint</I>

to print erroneous call graphs.
For example, if
<B>f</B>

calls
<B>g</B>

calls
<B>h</B>

and
<B>f</B>

and
<B>h</B>

are compiled with
<B>-b</B>,

but
<B>g</B>

is not,
<B>bprint</B>

will report that
<B>f</B>

called
<B>h</B>.

The total number of calls is correct, however.
