<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<I>lburg</I>

reads an lcc-style BURG specification from
<I>input</I>

and writes a pattern-matching code generator to
<I>output</I>.

If
<I>input</I>

is `-' or is omitted,
<I>lburg</I>

reads the standard input;
If
<I>output</I>

is `-' or is omitted,
<I>lburg</I>

writes to the standard output.
<P>

<I>lburg</I>

accepts specifications that conform to the following EBNF grammar.
Terminals are enclosed in single quotes or are
given in uppercase, all other symbols are nonterminals or English phrases,
{X} denotes zero or more instances of X, and [X] denotes an optional X.
<P>

<PRE>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>spec:     `%{' configuration `%}' { dcl } `%%' { rule }
               [ `%%' C code ]

dcl:      `%start' nonterm
          `%term' { ID `=' INT }

rule:     nonterm `:' tree template [ C expression ]

tree:     term `(' tree `,' tree `)'
          term `(' tree `)'
          term
          nonterm

nonterm:  ID

template: `&quot;' { any character except double quote } `&quot;'
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>

Specifications are structurally similar to
<I>yacc</I>'s.

Text between
`<TT>%{</TT>'
and
`<TT>%}</TT>'
is called the configuration section; there may be several such segments.
All are concatenated and copied verbatim into the head of the output.
Text after the second
`<TT>%%</TT>',
if any, is also copied verbatim into the output, at the end.
<P>

Specifications consist of declarations, a
`<TT>%%</TT>'
separator, and rules.
Input is line-oriented; each declaration and rule must appear on a separate line,
and declarations must begin in column 1.
Declarations declare terminals --- the operators in subject
trees --- and associate a unique, positive external symbol
number with each one.
Nonterminals are declared by their presence
on the left side of rules.  The
<TT>%start</TT>
declaration optionally declares a nonterminal as the start symbol.
In the grammar above,
<TT>term</TT>
and
<TT>nonterm</TT>
denote identifiers that are terminals and nonterminals.
<P>

Rules define tree patterns in a fully parenthesized prefix
form. Every nonterminal denotes a tree.
Each operator has a fixed
arity, which is inferred from the rules in which it is used.
A chain rule is a rule whose pattern is another nonterminal.
If no start symbol is declared, the nonterminal defined by the first rule is used.
<P>

Each rule ends with an expression that computes the cost of matching
that rule; omitted costs
default to zero. Costs of chain rules must be constants.
<P>

The configuration section configures the output
for the trees being parsed and the client's environment.
As shown, this section must define
<TT>NODEPTR_TYPE</TT>
to be a visible typedef symbol for a pointer to a
node in the subject tree.
The labeller invokes
<TT>OP_LABEL(p)</TT>,
<TT>LEFT_CHILD(p)</TT>, and
<TT>RIGHT_CHILD(p)</TT>
to read the operator and children from the node pointed to by <TT>p</TT>.
If the configuration section defines these operations as macros, they are implemented in-line;
otherwise, they must be implemented as functions.
<P>

The matcher
computes and stores a single integral state in each node of the subject tree.
The configuration section must define a macro
<TT>STATE_LABEL(p)</TT>
to access the state field of the node pointed to
by <TT>p</TT>. It must be large enough to hold a pointer, and
a macro is required because it is used as an lvalue.

<BR>


<DT><B>-p</B><I>prefix</I>

Use
<I>prefix</I>

as the disambiquating prefix for visible names and fields.
The default is `<TT>_</TT>'.
<DT><B>-T</B>

<DD>
Arrange for
<P>
<PRE>
    void _trace(NODEPTR_TYPE p, int eruleno,
                    int cost, int bestcost);

</PRE>


to be called at each successful match.
<TT>p</TT>
identifies the node and
<TT>eruleno</TT>
identifies the matching rule; the rules are numbered
beginning at 1 in the order they appear in the input.
<TT>cost</TT>
is the cost of the match and
<TT>bestcost</TT>
is the cost of the best previous match. The current match
wins only if
<TT>cost</TT>
is less than <TT>bestcost</TT>.
32767 represents the infinite cost of no previous match.
<TT>_trace</TT> must be declared in the configuration section.
